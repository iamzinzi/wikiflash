# Product Synopsis

> Wiki Flash is a game that helps you find the degrees of separation between two wikipedia pages. The search takes a minimun of two words, and they can be as random as, for example: "cucumber" and "Mikhail Lazarev".

 * first page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber
 * in this page, you find a link to “continents” => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent
 * in this new page, you find a link to “Antartica” => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica
 * and finally, you find the word “Mikhail Lazarev” => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lazarev
So the path for Cucumber -> Mikhail Lazarev is: Cucumber -> Continent -> Antartica -> Mikhail Lazarev = 3 steps

The product promises to take wikipedia’s basic search functionality to a new level where the user can interact and play with the shared knowledge Wikipedia provides, as well as making the search process fun.
